## Multicycle Implementation
Control unit implemented as a FSM (TODO: Diagram)

### Waveform (GTKWave)
[mem/test_rv32i.hex](mem/test_rv32i.hex)

As can be seen from the waveform, the JAL instruction (assembled `0x00C00A6F`) is located at PC `0x5C`, undergoes states `FETCH` -> `DECODE` -> `JAL` -> `FETCH` ...

During the `JAL` state, `PC+4` is written to register `x20`, as can be verified from the test program [asm/test_rv32i.s](asm/test_rv32i.s).

**Note**: `PC <= PC + 4` assignment is done at the `DECODE` state, due to branching instructions need the *unmodified* PC (i.e. *old* PC without incremented by 4).

## Pipelined Implementation
A somewhat simplified pipelined datapath without the control signals can be shown as:

## Pipeline Hazard Detection Logic

There are 3 types of hazards in pipelined designs:
- Structural Hazards (hardware resource conflicts)
- Data Hazards (execution has data dependency of previous results in the pipeline)
  - Write after write (WAW)
  - Write after read (WAR)
  - Read after write (RAW)
- Control Hazards (due to jump/branch instruction target prediction)

### Mitigating Hazards
#### Structural Hazards
Structural hazards are already mitigated by the design of RISC-V: It has two separate memory for text and data, dual port register file and exclusive ALU.
#### Data Hazards
**Data Forwarding**: An example of a RAW hazard is:
```s
lui x1, 0x0001
addi x1, x1, 0
```
In `addi`, it should read `x1` that is written by `lui`, but due to pipelining it reads the **old** value:
![raw_hazard](docs/raw_hazard.svg)

To resolve the dependency, we can add a forwarding that forwards the data (generated by the immediate generation unit at the ID stage) from the EX/MEM pipeline register to the input of the EX stage of `addi`.

A visual forwarding diagram is like:

![raw_hazard_forward](docs/raw_hazard_forward.svg)

RISC-V pipeline implementations are inherently resistant to WAW and WAR hazards, due to:
- **WAW**: Write operations "overwrite", so newer data is always overwritten by the next instruction.
- **WAR**: Since write is the last stage of the pipeline design, write operations are always completed after reads by the nature of the design, so read operations fetch the older data successfully, without being affected by the newer write instruction.

##### Pipeline Interlock
Pipeline interlock happens when there is a load-use hazard, specifically when there is a dependency between `lw` and `addi`, specifically when `addi` EX stage needs the data fetched that is present in the `MEM/WB` pipeline register, as shown in the diagram:
![pipeline_interlock](docs/riscv-raw_hazards_pi.svg) 

Since we can't forward data **back** in time, we have to stall the pipeline for 1 cycle to align the necessary stages:

![stall](docs/riscv-raw_hazards_stall.drawio.svg)

Therefore, data hazards can be mitigated by either stalling (LOAD-USE) or forwarding data based on detected dependencies.

#### Control Hazards
Control hazards can be mitigated by predicting whether the branch will be taken or not, usually by 2 different approaches in the `FETCH` stage:
- Static prediction
- Dynamic prediction

In the next cycle, either `PC+4` or `target` address will be in the fetch stage. In the `EXECUTE` stage of the branch, if the prediction is found wrong, then we have to **flush** the pipeline, fetching the correct instruction from the correct target.

##### Static Prediction
We can statically predict the branch to be taken for *all* jump and unconditional branch operations, and branch to be not taken for *all* conditional branch instructions.

## TODO
1) Add checks for `TEXT_MEM_BEGIN` and `DATA_MEM_BEGIN` memory ranges in `dmem` and `imem`.
